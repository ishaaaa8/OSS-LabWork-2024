## Function Name: mindistance
**Purpose:**  
Finds the index of the vertex with the smallest distance value that has not yet been processed (i.e., its status is false).
**Parameters:**  
- `distance[]` (int[]): An array where each element represents the current shortest distance from the source to each vertex.  
- `stat[]` (bool[]):  A boolean array where each element indicates whether the vertex has been processed (true) or not (false).  
**Return Value:**  
- `ind` (int): The index of the vertex with the minimum distance value that has not yet been processed


## Function Name: dijkstra
**Purpose:**  
Computes the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. It also prints the minimum number of stations from the source to every other station.
**Parameters:**  
- `graph[56][56]`(int[][]): An adjacency matrix where graph[i][j] represents the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. A non-zero value indicates the presence of an edge with that weight, while 0 indicates no edge.
- `source` (int): The starting vertex for the shortest path calculations.
- `stations[55]` (string[]): An array of station names where each index corresponds to a vertex in the graph.
**Return Value:**  
None. This function performs calculations and outputs the results directly.
